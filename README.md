# The Decisionator
The Decisionator is a playful static website that helps you make choices when you’re feeling indecisive — or just want to let fate (and a little humor) decide.

Enter any “Should I…” question, choose a speed mode (from fast and snappy to slow and dramatic), and get a yes/no answer paired with a witty, personality-driven response. Comes loaded with fun example prompts and a variety of lighthearted outcomes so every decision feels fresh.

Perfect for:

Breaking the tie when you can’t decide

Adding a little randomness to your day

Getting roasted (or encouraged) by your own website

Built with simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no fuss, just decisions.
